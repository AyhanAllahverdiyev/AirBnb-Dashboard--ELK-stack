# Kibana Dashboard and Elasticsearch Integration with Flutter App

This project demonstrates the creation of a comprehensive data visualization dashboard using Kibana, Elasticsearch, and Logstash. The dashboard collects data from the Airbnb sample dataset for New York and presents it through various charts, maps, areas, donuts, and pies. Users have the flexibility to apply filters to customize their data view. Additionally, a Flutter app has been developed to interact with Elasticsearch, allowing users to input queries and retrieve data with paging support.

## Introduction

This project showcases the integration of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana to build a data-driven dashboard. The Airbnb sample dataset for New York serves as the data source, collected and processed by Logstash before being indexed into Elasticsearch. The processed data is then visualized using Kibana's features, such as maps, charts, areas, donuts, and pies. Users can filter the data based on various criteria to obtain tailored insights.

## Features

- Data collection from Airbnb sample dataset using Logstash.
- Real-time indexing and storage of data in Elasticsearch.
- Kibana dashboard with a variety of visualization components.
- Interactive filters allowing users to dynamically modify data presentation.
- Integration of geographical data using Kibana maps.
- Flutter app for querying Elasticsearch and retrieving paginated data.

## Technologies Used

- Elasticsearch: A powerful search and analytics engine used to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- Logstash: A data processing pipeline that collects, processes, and transforms data before indexing it into Elasticsearch.
- Kibana: A data visualization and exploration tool for viewing data stored in Elasticsearch through a variety of graphical representations.
- Flutter: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana as per your environment. [Provide relevant links or instructions if necessary]
3. Import the Airbnb sample dataset into Elasticsearch using Logstash configurations [Include necessary steps].
4. Import the Kibana dashboard configuration to visualize the data [Include necessary steps].
5. Build and run the Flutter app on your desired platform [Include necessary steps].

## Usage

- Access the Kibana dashboard through your web browser [Include URL].
- Explore various visualizations and apply filters to interact with the data.
- Use the Flutter app to input queries and retrieve data from Elasticsearch.
- Paging support in the Flutter app ensures smooth navigation through query results.

## Flutter App

The included Flutter app allows users to interact with Elasticsearch and retrieve data based on their queries. The app communicates with Elasticsearch's REST API to request data and handles pagination for displaying large result sets. Users can enter their queries and view the paginated data on the app's interface.
